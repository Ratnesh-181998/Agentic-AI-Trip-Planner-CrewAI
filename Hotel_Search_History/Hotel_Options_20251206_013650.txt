## 2. Recommendation

- **Best option for budget:** Hotel O Data Shree (OYO Rooms), if the price remains similar to current rates.
- **Best option for comfort/speed:** OYO Flagship 81448 Hotel Rajwada could be a good balance, but check recent reviews closer to the date of travel. Also, browse Tripadvisor for traveler-recommended budget hotels with good ratings.

## 3. Practical Tips for Hotels

- **Booking advice:** Book in advance, especially if traveling during peak season (December). Compare prices across multiple websites like Booking.com, Tripadvisor, and OYO. Check for deals and discounts. Pay attention to cancellation policies.
- **What to expect:** Budget hotels in Udaipur usually offer basic amenities like clean rooms, attached bathrooms, and sometimes free Wi-Fi. Don't expect luxurious facilities at these prices. Confirm check-in/check-out times and any extra charges beforehand. Be prepared to show a valid photo ID at check-in. Since the check-in date (2025-12-14) is later than the check-out date (2025-12-06), ensure that you confirm this with the hotel directly to avoid any booking issues.
