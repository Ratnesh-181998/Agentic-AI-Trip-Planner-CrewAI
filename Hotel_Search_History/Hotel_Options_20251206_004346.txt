## 3. Practical Tips for Hotels

- **Booking advice:**
    - Book in advance: Goa is a popular destination, especially in December. Booking at least a month or two in advance can help secure better rates and availability.
    - Compare prices: Check multiple booking websites (Goibibo, Booking.com, MakeMyTrip) to compare prices and find the best deals.
    - Read reviews: Before booking, carefully read recent reviews to understand the experiences of other guests. Pay attention to comments about cleanliness, service, and location.
    - Check cancellation policies: Make sure you understand the hotel's cancellation policy before booking. Look for flexible options that allow you to cancel or modify your reservation without incurring hefty fees.

- **What to expect:**
    - Location: Anjuna and Baga (where Hotel Orion and Hotel Sai Baga are located) are lively areas in North Goa known for beaches, nightlife, and markets. Morjim is relatively quieter.
    - Amenities: Budget hotels may offer basic amenities such as air conditioning, private bathrooms, and Wi-Fi. Do not expect luxurious facilities.
    - Transportation: Consider renting a scooter for easy transportation within Goa. Public transport is available but can be infrequent and crowded.
    - Bargaining: It's often possible to bargain for better prices, especially if you are booking for a longer stay or during the off-season.
