## 3. Practical Tips for Trains

- **What to expect:**
    - Trains can sometimes be delayed, so factor in potential delays when planning onward travel.
    - Carry a valid photo ID (Aadhar card, passport, etc.) along with your ticket.
    - Food vendors are usually available on board, but it's a good idea to bring your own snacks and water as well.
    - Keep your belongings secure, especially during overnight journeys.
    - Confirm platform number upon arrival at the station via inquiry or display boards.
