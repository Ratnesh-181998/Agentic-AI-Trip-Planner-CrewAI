    - Book in advance (1-3 months prior) as trains get full quickly, especially during peak season (December).
    - Check IRCTC website for real-time availability and pricing.
    - Consider booking in Tatkal quota if booking close to the travel date, but it's more expensive and has limited availability.

- What to expect:
    - Train journeys in India can be long, so pack essentials like water, snacks, and entertainment.
    - Confirm your seat number and coach upon boarding.
    - Keep your valuables safe.
    - Be aware of train delays, especially during monsoon season.
    - Carry a valid ID proof.
