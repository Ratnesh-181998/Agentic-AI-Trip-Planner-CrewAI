- **Booking advice:** Book in advance for better prices. December is a peak travel season, so book as early as possible. Compare prices on multiple platforms and airline websites. Be flexible with your travel dates to find better deals.
- **What to expect:** Ensure you have a valid ID. Arrive at the airport at least 2 hours before domestic flights. Check baggage allowance policies for your chosen airline to avoid extra charges. Keep an eye on flight status for any delays or cancellations, especially closer to the travel date. Be prepared for potential crowds during the holiday season.
